<p><i>The problem</i>. An Internet revolution is transforming the way scholars
communicate. Over the next twenty years, printed journals will largely be replaced by
publications online. This has occurred already in fields such as mathematics and
high-energy physics, while other fields continue to rely on established hierarchies of
printed journals. These journals have been a profitable business for a few multinational
publishers, but as titles proliferate and subscription costs rise, universities, research
libraries, and professional societies are promoting more efficient Web-based alternatives.
How the transition to online communication plays out in North America and Europe will
affect the accessibility of scientific information in countries like Thailand and will
shape the evolution of their research communities. Managers of scientific information in
Southeast Asia will need to meet a broad range of local needs by rethinking the role of
traditional publishers and university libraries, and perhaps by creating alternatives of
their own [<a HREF="#baker">Baker 1999</a>]. </p>

<p><i>The course</i>. We took this issue as the focus of an experimental seminar in
Information Management at the Asian Institute of Technology in the Fall term of 1998. The
purpose of this paper is to describe how we coached the students in addressing the problem
themselves through empirical research. Through our classroom methods, we aimed to
introduce students to the nature of research problems and the global discourse communities
that form around them; to the design of qualitative research and its presentation in
writing; and to collaboration in research teams. The program in Information Management at
AIT produces graduates who will confront the transition to a Web-based information market
as professionals in a wide range of institutional and disciplinary settings. This course
drew on AIT's strongest resource -- its faculty -- to acquaint students with a sample of
such settings.</p>

<p><i>Asian Institute of Technology</i>. AIT was founded with development aid in 1959 to
meet a growing need for advanced engineering education in Asia. Its four Schools offer
masters degrees and doctorates in Advanced Technologies; Civil Engineering; Environment,
Resources, and Development; and Management. It has roughly 1,300 students, mostly from
Asia, and about 150 full-time faculty members. The Institute is supported by a wide range
of donor governments, international agencies, foundations, and corporations, along with a
growing number of fee-paying students. Many faculty members are sponsored by governments
or foundations in Asia, Europe, and North America. AIT aims at educating people for key
positions in the economies and societies of Southeast Asia. Part of its mission is to take
``a leadership role in the promotion of technological change and its management for
sustainable development in the Asia and Pacific region, through high-level education,
research and outreach activities which integrate technology, planning and management'' [<a HREF="#ait">AIT</a>].</p>

<p><i>The students</i>. Students often come to AIT with good basic skills and English
language competence but little experience with the ethos and culture of academic research.
By the time they graduate -- often in less than two years -- they are expected to identify
a research problem, design a method for its study, conduct research, and write it all up
in an appropriate format and in good professional English. A special academic unit at AIT,
the Center for Language and Educational Technology (CLET), helps guide students through
this process.</p>

<p><i>The classroom method</i>. A faculty workshop in the Spring of 1998 concluded that
academic ethos and professional style are best taught in the context of regular academic
courses. Accordingly, Tom Baker of the Department of Computer Science and Information
Management designed the course in collaboration with Terry Clayton of CLET. We offered the
course in the Fall term -- just before students begin to define their thesis topics. Our
intention was to walk students through the steps of turning a given problem into a
research design, conducting interviews, presenting preliminary results, and at least
starting an analysis of trends and patterns. We began the course by introducing the
problem of academic research in the Web age. As a class, we then drafted a schedule of
interview questions for discovering how faculty members collect the information they need
for their work and how they communicate with colleagues, with particular attention to
their use of information technologies and the role of print versus electronic resources.
Students were responsible for forming research groups and managing the logistics of
interviewing faculty members from the four Schools.</p>

<p><i>Faculty interviewed</i>. The sixteen students in the class formed three working
groups and paired off to conduct interviews with thirty faculty members from AIT's four
Schools. Twelve of the faculty members were from Western countries and eighteen from the
Asia-Pacific region, specifically: Thailand (8); Australia, Bangladesh (2), India (3),
Japan (2), the Philippines, and Vietnam; Bulgaria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France (2),
Netherlands, Norway, Germany, and the USA (3). Their doctorates were awarded in Europe
(11), North America (9), Japan (4), India (2), Australia (2), and at AIT itself (2). The
data from this small and atypical sample are insufficient for meaningful generalizations,
but they do suggest some directions for further research.</p>

<p><i>Print versus Web</i>. Most faculty members said that their academic fields rely
heavily on literature in print, certainly for academic promotion at AIT. Most emphasized
the importance of attending conferences abroad to maintain personal contact with their
fields. Everyone reported using email, though their attitudes ranged from avid to
reluctant. Most also used the Web to some extent, whether to read professional news, scan
journals, or find course outlines. A few pointed to extensive and well-maintained Web
sites in their fields, some of which are operated by professional societies in Europe,
North America, or Japan. Four reported using the Web more extensively for conducting
text-based chat sessions with students, posting course materials, or engaging in
professional email discussions. Three exchange environmental data from Thailand with
colleagues in other countries. Some explained these practices in terms of professional
culture, which ranged from the very open field of Urban Development, where preprints and
advice are freely shared, to Food Technology, where research results can translate into
commercial advantage and data are carefully protected from appropriation by competitors
until they are formally published.</p>

<p><i>The role of the library</i>. The shape of the collection of the Library at AIT
reflects broader historical trends, from the growth of AIT in the 1960s and 1970s through
the economic boom years of the 1980s to the international journal crunch of the 1990s and,
since July 1997, a regional currency crisis. Two-thirds of the monographs on the library
shelves today date from before 1985, while only 5% were published after 1994. Serial runs
often start in the 1970s and break off in the late 1980s. Many reference works are ten or
fifteen years out of date. Some of the faculty members surveyed felt that their fields
were adequately covered, but twice as many felt that the monographs were out of date and
journal coverage was insufficient. This may in part reflect the observation that two years
or more can pass from the drafting and submission of a manuscript to its availability on
library shelves in Thailand. This lag in availability is more serious in some fields than
in others. In rapidly changing fields such as computer science, older works quickly lose
all but historical interest. In fields such as digital libraries, which has developed
almost entirely on the Web, the currency of materials in the library is of less
consequence.</p>

<p><i>Alternatives to the library</i>. These shortcomings are compensated in part by other
libraries on campus, in Thailand, or abroad. A few departments maintain their own
collections of journals and reference works. One faculty member periodically visits
specialized libraries in Bangkok. In one sub-field related to agriculture, a key journal
is available at only one library in all of Thailand. Several faculty members rely on
colleagues or libraries in their home countries to supply them with materials, build
personal collections of books, or subscribe to key journals at their own expense. Others
use brochures and alerting services from publishers or the AIT Library to place orders for
photocopies or publisher reprints. A few reported some benefit from bibliographic
databases that were offered at the AIT Library for limited trial periods.</p>

<p><i>Discourse communities</i>. The initial interview results showed that students had
not always grasped the nature of a faculty member's field of research. After discussing
readings on the nature and definition of discourse communities [<a HREF="#swales">Swales
1986</a>], students returned to one of their respondents for advice on exploring that
scholar's field. Some students examined professional societies, though we concluded that
bodies of 1,500 members lack the intensity of communication characteristic of smaller
communities. Other students identified specialized communities with perhaps five key
journals and 100 members world-wide on specific topics ranging from ``conceptual graphs''
in computer science to ``artificial insemination of fish'' and ``urban environment
management in underserviced areas.'' We discussed research communities that define
themselves as the intersection of two larger disciplines, such as ``artificial
intelligence in power systems'' and ``computer-based simulation of construction.'' Some of
the students examined in detail the extent to which articles in a sub-field cited an
identifiable cluster of key researchers or journals. This follow-up assignment generated a
wide range of concrete examples to illustrate our reading of theory and led to insights on
the nature of scholarly communication.</p>

<p><i>Information technology in the classroom.</i> Just as the networked environment is
facilitating interaction among scholars, we felt that students should be familiar with
some basic tools for collaboration. Rather than just lecture about the technology, we used
it in support of the coursework. The interview schedules were drafted and revised as a
class using a simple text editor and a data projector. Email was the staple medium for
formal and informal communication, and AIT's Internetworking Research Laboratory (now part
of a new Distributed Education Center) provided a Web-based archive of all mail to the
class list [<a HREF="#dec">DEC</a>]. Class notes, lecture slides, readings, assignments,
and reports were shared through Basic Support for Cooperative Work, a password-protected
work environment where students could post and edit their individual and group writing
assignments for access by others via a Web browser [<a HREF="#dec">BSCW</a>]. Students
became adept at condensing interview notes into concise slide presentations.</p>

<p><i>Qualitative methods</i>. Many of our students will eventually have some role in
developing information systems for their organizations. Experience in qualitative research
methods, particularly interviewing techniques, will help them discover and formulate
system requirements. We spent some time distinguishing between ``interpretive'' and
``normative'' approaches to research (i.e., collecting complex, narrative data and
analyzing it for patterns versus collecting data pre-reduced to normalized categories for
quantification). Pedagogically, we considered the course a form of ``problem-based
learning,'' in which the achievement of understanding is seen as an approximate and
iterative process [<a HREF="#boud">Boud and Feletti 1991</a>].</p>

<p><i>Time management</i>. Student reports of their research experiences stimulated a
critical assessment of our progress within the given time frame. In order to have the
campus clear for the Asian Games, the Fall trimester had been shortened to just ten weeks;
mid-term presentations were held after just five. Working in much the same way as a
contract research group in the real world gave us the flexibility to adjust our goals in
light of our results and deadlines. We ended up reducing the breadth of our interviews and
following up in depth with selected members of our original sample. Such mid-course
corrections, of course, are common in the production of masters theses.</p>

<p><i>Forms of expression</i>. Communication in a networked environment is not a software
issue. Much of our feedback centered on defining and clarifying our expectations for
appropriate forms of written and oral presentation. We emphasized that styles vary between
discourse communities and need to be negotiated with relevant stakeholders. While
acknowledging a bias for plain writing, we noted differences between formal and informal
modes, simplicity and verbosity, and unadorned text versus multimedia effects. We
encouraged students to revise their texts and resubmit, and we demanded a high level of
structural coherence and grammatical accuracy. The final analyses from all three working
groups were posted to a common work space and were required reading for the final exam we
were required to give.</p>

<p><i>Evaluation</i>. As of the mid-term, over 90% of our participants 'agreed' or
'strongly agreed' that they were learning something of value, that the course aims were
being achieved, and that the assignments were 'suitable'; about 75% felt they were
understanding the subject. (Evaluation sheets were not available in time for the final.)
In fairness, we must acknowledge that the second five weeks of the course felt somewhat
more rushed as we pushed to meet our objectives; in particular, some students felt
confused about our expectations as we moved from data collection to analysis, though this
is not unlike projects in the real world. Reactions from students were generally positive,
and the experience helped at least some of them formulate thesis topics in the following
term.</p>

<p><i>Future directions</i>. This course did not yield publishable data. We wonder,
however, how a future course might build on this beginning. Could it take up where we left
off? Perhaps it could start by reviewing the results of the previous course, providing
students with an example of how research actually progresses. Given more data, the
information strategies of faculty members might appear as an interesting taxonomy. The
classroom itself could become an object of reflection on the use of ``distance education''
technologies within a single campus. The instructors might want to investigate how
universities around the world are starting to treat electronic publications in faculty
evaluations. Along with our students, we finished the course with some excitement about
the possibilities of helping students in the classroom make real contributions to
professional knowledge.</p>
